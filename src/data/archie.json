To reflect the most recent trends in course selection by UC Berkeley students, we limited our analysis to only consider data from the spring 2017 semester and filtered out course enrollments by campus visitors such as study abroad students. In the chart below, the color value of each square reflects how much more likely the corresponding major is to enroll in the corresponding department’s courses than other students. Darker pink indicates more and lighter pink less. Comparing the proportions of every major’s enrollment in departments to the proportions of all student enrollments in departments yielded the numeric values that determined color values."},{"type":"d3-graphic","id":"matrix"}]}
